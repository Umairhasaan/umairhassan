        <h1> 
            Life of Muhammad(S.W.A) 
        </h1>

        <p>

       <b>Muhammad </b>  was orphaned at the age of six when his mother died, and went to live with his <strong>grandfather Abd-Al-Muttalib</strong>, who was in charge of providing the water of the <i> Zam-Zam </i> to pilgrims.  But by the time he was eight years old, his grandfather, too, had died and Muhammad was taken in by his Uncle <em> Abu Talib </em> and employed in his successful caravan business, so he was saved from a life of slavery or indebtedness experienced by so many orphans at the time. In a story that resembles that of Samuel in the Old Testament and others of that genre, it was on a trading expedition to Syria, when <small>Muhammad </small>   was only nine years old, that a Christian monk named Bahira recognized him as “the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds.”

        <p>
           <mark> At twenty-five, when Muhammad was still unmarried and dependent on his uncle,</mark>  he met a very distant cousin, Khadija, a beautiful widow, then probably in her late thirties. Khadija was unusual for a woman of her time, she was a respected member of Meccan society and a very successful businesswoman in her own right. In spite of his tenuous social circumstances, according to Ibn Hisham, Muhammad had a reputation for <ins> “truthfulness</ins>, reliability, and nobility of character,” and  <del>Khadija entrusted him to take a caravan of goods to Syria and sell it. </del>

        <p>
           <q>  When he returned home with more profits than she anticipated, she proposed marriage to him and he accepted, thus acquiring status and entry into Meccan society. </q> 
           <blockquote   cite = "http :/www.google.com"> Although polygamy was the norm at the time, Muhammad and Khadija were in a monogamous marriage for twenty-five years until her death. They had six children.</blockquote>

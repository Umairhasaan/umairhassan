                 <abbr title = "world health organization" > WHO </abbr> Jinnah started his political career with Indian National Congress in 1906, then after seven years, he joined the Muslim League. He struggled a lot to bring congress and Muslim League to work together but at the same time, he found the culture of racialism in the sub-continent and realized that the Muslims of the sub-continent are sacrificing their cultural and social rights under the British and Hindus. Then he started his efforts for the freedom of Muslims of British India and planned to create an independent state where Muslims could feel the breath of freedom. The major strength was the unity of all Muslims organizations in this freedom war, and it is the leadership of Quaid e Azam which unites all the Muslims of the sub-continent on the same agenda of having a separate state. The creation of Pakistan is the result of bloodshed of thousands of freedom fighters as well as the leadership of Jinnah, Pakistan would not come into being without him.
